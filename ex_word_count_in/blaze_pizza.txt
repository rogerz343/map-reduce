Blaze Pizza 

Blaze Pizza LLC is a Pasadena, California-based chain within the fast-casual dining restaurants category. Founded in 2011 by Elise and Rick Wetzel of Wetzel’s Pretzels, Blaze Pizza was modeled after the Chipotle concept as a made-to-order approach to serving customers. National Basketball Association (NBA) champion LeBron James is one of the original investors in the chain, which is touted by Bloomberg “as the next Chipotle”.

Blaze Pizza was ranked as the #2 brand in the 2015 Fast Casual Top 100.

Besides competing against traditional pizza restaurants, such as Pizza Hut and Sbarro, and quick service fast casual, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express, Blaze Pizza competes directly with larger-sized MOD Pizza, Pieology & Pizza Rev and also with much smaller quick service pizza restaurant chains such as Azzip Pizza, Pie Five, and Chipotle-backed Pizzeria Locale.
Concept

Blaze Pizza’s name was derived from how quickly a create-your-own pizza can be “Fast Fire’d” in a high-temperature open-flame oven – an average cook time is 3 minutes. Customers begin by choosing which of the ingredients they’d like on their pizza pie. As customers work their way down the service line, staff assemble a pizza based on customer instructions. When they arrive at the end of the line, their custom-built pizza is ready to be cooked.

The Blaze ovens are "7 foot (2.1 m)-wide gas-fired (60,000 BTU (63,000 kJ)) unit operated at average temperatures of 700 °F (371 °C) to 800 °F (427 °C)" according to the company's executive chef. Since the high-temperature gas-fired pizza oven is the only piece of cooking equipment inside each of the restaurants, the same oven is also used to roast the chicken, cook the Italian sausage and meatballs, and bake some of the desserts.
History

In 2014, Zagat noted Blaze Pizza as “One of 10 innovative restaurants around Los Angeles.” During the first year of operation, the Irvine location did about $1.8 million and the Pasadena location did about $2.5 million. The concept’s popularity has been fueled by its obsessive attention to food, design and its unique service culture.

Each restaurant makes its own dough in-house from scratch. Dough is fermented in the restaurant for 24 hours before use. Blaze offers an optional gluten-free dough and vegan cheese.

Executive Chef Brad Kent, a Culinary Institute of America in New York graduate with a degree in food science and nutrition, is responsible for creating Blaze Pizza’s dough and signature recipes.
